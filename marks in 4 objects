9. Write a program to enter the marks of a student in four subjects. 
Then calculate the total and aggregate, display the grade obtained 
by the student. If the student scores an aggregate greater than 
75%, then the grade is Distinction. If aggregate is 60>= and <75, 
then the grade is First Division. If aggregate is 50 >= and <60, 
then the grade is Second Division. If aggregate is 40>= and <50, 
then the grade is Third Division. Else the grade is Fail. 
Sample Input & Output: 
Enter the marks in python: 90 
Enter the marks in c programming: 91 
Enter the marks in Mathematics: 92 
Enter the marks in Physics: 93

CODE:

        int a2 = 91;
        int a3 = 92;
        int a4 = 93;

        int total = a1 + a2 + a3 + a4;
        double aggregate = total / 4.0;

        System.out.println("Total = " + total);
        System.out.println("Aggregate = " + aggregate);

        if (aggregate > 75) {
            System.out.println("DISTINCTION");
        } else if (aggregate >= 60) {
            System.out.println("FIRST DIVISION");
        } else if (aggregate >= 50) {
            System.out.println("SECOND DIVISION");
        } else if (aggregate >= 40) {
            System.out.println("THIRD DIVISION");
        } else {
            System.out.println("FAIL");
        }
    }
