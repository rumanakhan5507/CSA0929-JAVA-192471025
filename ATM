3. Write a program to print the total amount available in the ATM machine with the 
conditions applied. 
Total denominations are 2000, 500, 200, 100, get the denomination priority from the user 
and the total number of notes from the user to display the total available balance to the user 
Sample Input: 
Enter the 1st Denomination: 500 
Enter the 1st Denomination number of notes: 4 
Enter the 2nd Denomination: 100 
Enter the 2nd  Denomination number of notes: 20 
Enter the 3rd  Denomination: 200 
Enter the 3rd  Denomination number of notes: 32 
Enter the 4th Denomination: 2000 
Enter the 4th Denomination number of notes: 1 
Sample Output: 
Total Available Balance in ATM: 12400

CODE: 
public class ATMBalance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Sample Input
        int d1 = 500, n1 = 4;    // denomination 1 and its notes
        int d2 = 100, n2 = 20;   // denomination 2 and its notes
        int d3 = 200, n3 = 32;   // denomination 3 and its notes
        int d4 = 2000, n4 = 1;   // denomination 4 and its notes

        int total = (d1 * n1) + (d2 * n2) + (d3 * n3) + (d4 * n4);

        System.out.println("Total Available Balance in ATM: " + total);
    }
}
