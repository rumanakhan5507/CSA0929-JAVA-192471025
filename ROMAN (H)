15. Roman 
numerals 
are 
symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M. 
Symbol       
Value 
I             1 
V             5 
X             10 
L
             50 
C             100 
D             500 
M
             1000 
represented 
by 
seven 
different 
 
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is 
written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which 
is XX + V + II. 
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, 
the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because 
the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the 
number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is 
used: 
 I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.  
 X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.  
 C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900. 
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. 
  
Example: 
Input: s = "III" 
Output: 3 

CODE: 
public class RomanToInteger {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "IX"; // change this to test
        int total = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            int curr = 0;
            if (s.charAt(i) == 'I') curr = 1;
            else if (s.charAt(i) == 'V') curr = 5;
            else if (s.charAt(i) == 'X') curr = 10;
            else if (s.charAt(i) == 'L') curr = 50;
            else if (s.charAt(i) == 'C') curr = 100;
            else if (s.charAt(i) == 'D') curr = 500;
            else if (s.charAt(i) == 'M') curr = 1000;

            // check next symbol
            if (i + 1 < s.length()) {
                int next = 0;
                char ch = s.charAt(i + 1);
                if (ch == 'I') next = 1;
                else if (ch == 'V') next = 5;
                else if (ch == 'X') next = 10;
                else if (ch == 'L') next = 50;
                else if (ch == 'C') next = 100;
                else if (ch == 'D') next = 500;
                else if (ch == 'M') next = 1000;

                if (curr < next) {
                    total += (next - curr);
                    i++; // skip next
                    continue;
                }
            }
            total += curr;
        }

        System.out.println("Roman " + s + " = " + total);
    }
}
