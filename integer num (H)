18. Given an integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. In one step, if 
the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 
1 from it. 
Example 1: 
Input: num = 14 
Output: 6 
Explanation:  
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7.  
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6. 
 
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3.  
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2.  
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.  
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0. 

CODE:
public class ReduceToZero {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 14;  // change this to test
        int steps = 0;

        while (num > 0) {
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                num = num / 2;  // divide by 2 if even
            } else {
                num = num - 1;  // subtract 1 if odd
            }
            steps++;
        }

        System.out.println("Number of steps: " + steps);
    }
}
