19. Develop a programme that uses Multiple Inheritance concepts to compute a student's 
grades in six subjects. The total and aggregate are then calculated, and the student's 
grade is displayed. If the student achieves an aggregate of more than 75%, the grade is 
Distinction. If the aggregate is between 60 and 75, the grade is First Division. If the 
aggregate is between 50 and 60, the grade is Second Division. If the aggregate is between 
40 and 50, the grade is Third Division. Otherwise, the grade is FAIL.
