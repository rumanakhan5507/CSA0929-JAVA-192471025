CODE: 
public class BankAccountSimple {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Account details
        String name = "Romi";
        String accountNumber = "ACC12345";
        String accountType = "Savings";
        double balance = 10000; // assumed initial balance

        System.out.println("Account Details:");
        System.out.println("Depositor Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Account Number: " + accountNumber);
        System.out.println("Account Type: " + accountType);
        System.out.println("Balance: " + balance);
        System.out.println();

        // Deposit an amount
        double depositAmount = 2000;
        balance = balance + depositAmount;
        System.out.println("Amount deposited: " + depositAmount);
        System.out.println("Updated balance: " + balance);
        System.out.println();

        // Withdraw an amount
        double withdrawAmount = 9500;
        if (balance - withdrawAmount >= 500) {
            balance = balance - withdrawAmount;
            System.out.println("Amount withdrawn: " + withdrawAmount);
            System.out.println("Updated balance: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Cannot withdraw " + withdrawAmount + ". Minimum balance Rs.500 must be maintained.");
        }
    }
}
