1. Write a Java Program to Convert a Given Number of Days in Terms of Years, Weeks 
& Days. 
Sample Input&Output:: 
Enter the number of days:756 
No. of years:2 
No. of weeks:3 
No. of days:5 
Given a date, return the corresponding day of the week for that date. 
The input is given as three integers representing the day, month and year respectively. 
Return the answer as one of the following values {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", 
"Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"}. 
Example 1: 
Input: day = 31, month = 8, year = 2019 
Output: "Saturday" 
Example 2: 
Input: day = 18, month = 7, year = 1999 
Output: "Sunday" 
Example 3: 
Input: day = 15, month = 8, year = 1993 
Output: "Sunday" 
Constraints: 
ï‚· The given dates are valid dates between the years 1971 and 2100.

CODE: 
public class CombinedProgram {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // ----- PART 1: Convert Days to Years, Weeks, and Days -----
        int totalDays = 756; // Change this value to test
        int years = totalDays / 365;
        int remainingDays = totalDays % 365;
        int weeks = remainingDays / 7;
        int days = remainingDays % 7;

        System.out.println("Days Conversion:");
        System.out.println("No. of years: " + years);
        System.out.println("No. of weeks: " + weeks);
        System.out.println("No. of days: " + days);
        System.out.println();

        // ----- PART 2: Find Day of the Week for a Given Date -----
        int dayInput = 31;   // Change these values to test
        int monthInput = 8;
        int yearInput = 2019;

        // Adjust month and year for Zeller's Congruence
        int day = dayInput;
        int month = monthInput;
        int year = yearInput;

        if (month < 3) {
            month += 12;
            year -= 1;
        }

        int k = year % 100; // year of the century
        int j = year / 100; // zero-based century

        int f = day + (13 * (month + 1)) / 5 + k + (k / 4) + (j / 4) + (5 * j);
        int dayOfWeek = f % 7;

        String[] daysOfWeek = {"Saturday", "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"};

        System.out.println("Day of the Week:");
        System.out.println(dayInput + "/" + monthInput + "/" + yearInput + " is " + daysOfWeek[dayOfWeek]);
    }
}
OUTPUT: 
Days Conversion:
No. of years: 2
No. of weeks: 3
No. of days: 5

Day of the Week:
31/8/2019 is Saturday
