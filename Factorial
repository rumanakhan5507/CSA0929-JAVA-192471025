20. Find the factorial of n? 
Sample Input: 
N = 4 
Sample Output: 
4 Factorial = 24 
Test cases: 
1. N = 0 
2. N = -5 
3. N = 1 
4. N = Q 
5. N = 3A
CODE: 
public class Factorial {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 5;  
        int factorial = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
            factorial = factorial * i;
        }

        System.out.println("Factorial of " + num + " is " + factorial);
    }
}
