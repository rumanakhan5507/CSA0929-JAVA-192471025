2. Write a program to find the number of student users in the college, get the total users, 
staff users details from the client. Note for every 3 staff user there is one Non teaching 
staff user assigned by default.  
Sample Input: 
 
Total Users: 856 
Staff Users: 126 
Sample Output: 
Student Users: 688 

CODE:
public class CollegeUsers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Input values (change these to test)
        int totalUsers = 856;
        int staffUsers = 126;

        // Calculate non-teaching staff
        int nonTeachingStaff = staffUsers / 3;

        // Student users = Total users - (Staff users + Non-teaching staff)
        int studentUsers = totalUsers - (staffUsers + nonTeachingStaff);

        System.out.println("Total Users: " + totalUsers);
        System.out.println("Staff Users: " + staffUsers);
        System.out.println("Non-Teaching Staff: " + nonTeachingStaff);
        System.out.println("Student Users: " + studentUsers);
    }
}
OUTPUT: 
Total Users: 856
Staff Users: 126
Non-Teaching Staff: 42
Student Users: 688
