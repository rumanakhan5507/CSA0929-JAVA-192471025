3. Write a program to print number of factors and to print nth factor of the 
given number. 
Sample Input: 
Given Number: 100 
N = 4 
Sample Output: 
Number of factors = 9 
4th factor of 100 = 5 

CODE: 
public class FactorsProgram {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Input values (change these to test)
        int number = 100;
        int n = 4;

        int count = 0;
        int nthFactor = -1; // default if n is larger than total factors

        System.out.print("Factors of " + number + ": ");
        for (int i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
            if (number % i == 0) {
                count++; // counting the factor
                System.out.print(i + " "); // optional: display all factors
                if (count == n) {
                    nthFactor = i; // save the nth factor
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println("\nNumber of factors = " + count);
        if (nthFactor != -1) {
            System.out.println(n + "th factor of " + number + " = " + nthFactor);
        } else {
            System.out.println(n + "th factor does not exist.");
        }
    }
}
OUTPUT:
Factors of 100: 1 2 4 5 10 20 25 50 100 
Number of factors = 9
4th factor of 100 = 5
