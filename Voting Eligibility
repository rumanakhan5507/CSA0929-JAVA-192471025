4. Write a program to find whether the person is eligible for vote or not. And if that 
particular person is not eligible, then print how many years are left to be eligible. 
Sample Input: 
 Enter your age: 
7 
Sample output: 
You are allowed to vote after 11 years

CODE: 
public class VoteEligibility
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int age = 7;  
        int requiredAge = 18;

        if (age >= requiredAge) {
            System.out.println("You are eligible to vote.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("You are allowed to vote after " + (requiredAge - age) + " years");
        }
    }
}
