8. Write a program using function to calculate the simple interest. Suppose the 
customer is a senior citizen. He is being offered 12 percent rate of interest; 
for all other customers, the ROI is 10 percent. 
Sample Input: 
Enter the principal amount: 200000 
Enter the no of years:  3 
Is customer senior citizen (y/n): n 
Sample Output: 
Interest: 60000

CODE: 
public class SimpleInterest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int principal = 200000;   
        int years = 3;           
        char senior = 'n';        

        double rate = 10;         
        if (senior == 'y') {
            rate = 12;            
        }

        double interest = (principal * years * rate) / 100;

        System.out.println("Interest: " + interest);
    }
}
